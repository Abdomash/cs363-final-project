## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of MRI images into categories indicating the presence or absence of a brain tumor. The project uses machine learning techniques to predict and classify MRI images accurately. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and includes images labeled as

- **glioma**
- **meningioma**
- **pituitary**
- **no tumor**.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to employ various machine learning algorithms to classify MRI images, helping in the early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors. The project aims to explore the effectiveness of different algorithms and feature engineering techniques in improving classification accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed on Kaggle at [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset). It consists of MRI images classified into two categories: with tumor and without tumor.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project, you will need Python and several libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

To install the required libraries:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Provides an overview of the project and setup instructions.
- `brain_tumor_classification.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing all the project code and documentation.
- `requirements.txt` - A text file listing the project's dependencies.
